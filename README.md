# Bash
My .bashrc's methods that aren't standard. For easy grabbing on different computers. 

`up x`\n
Where x is the amount of directories to. "up 2" = "cd ../../"

`extract filename`\n
Extract file independent of what kind of compression used. 

`mkcdir directory`\n
Makes directory (mkdir) *directory* and then goes into it (cd)
